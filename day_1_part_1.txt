intro to basic recursion (like factorial printting and fibinocci )

example 1:
next question on stairs sum 
https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
slight modification to this quesion (you can climb 1,2,3 steps at a time, find out how many distinct ways you can reach the nth step)

anylyze the problem like this way 
Level - current stair where we are standing 
choice  - if we are at a particular level think of the choices like how many we have (like we have here 1,2,3 choices)
check  - check whether it is a valid choice or not (like we should not move out of the bound) (these checks may be relevent in most of the problems) 
move  - we have to move to that choice (and take a new reference form there) 
        here exploring the choice and coming back
        move to step (level +1/2/3)
        
        for today build a way how we can solve this using the brief idea you have ,and code accordingly with what you know (brute force)
        
     
example 2:
no of ways to place n no of queens  (there is also another question ,like no of ways to place two queens so that no attacker can attack the queens on nXn chessboard)

but this question is of placing n queens on a NxN chessboard so that no two queens attack each other 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-queen-problem-backtracking-3/

now for n=1 (we will have one way )
now for n=2 ( we cannot place the queeens satisfying the given condition )
now for n=3 (here also we cannot find the no of ways , satisying the condition)
now for n=8 we will have 92 ways 

level  (move each cell and explore the choices )
choice  place or not place
check  if we can place the queen or not
move   place the queen / not place the queen 

here we should note that in one row there can be only one queen in one row and one clonumn 

level - row 
choice - coloumn 
check -whether there is attack from the previous queens 
move - place queen and move to next level

exmple 3:
in az workshop we have n questions and and ith problem takes {Ti , Si} time ti and increase skill by Si
you have x time and k slots 
find maximum skill you can get 
exaample 
{3,3} {5,4} {4,1} {2,3} {1,1}
x=6 k=2 

level -item. like for each item we have to take one more item as we have to choose 2 items 
choice  - take/ not take 
check  - time and count check
move  -take this item and move forward (and explore other items)
